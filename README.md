ðŸ“± Megaline Plan Predictor
ðŸ“– Project Overview

Megaline, a mobile carrier, has discovered that many subscribers still use legacy plans. To improve customer experience, they want to recommend one of their newer plans â€” Smart or Ultra â€” based on user behavior.

This project develops a machine learning model that analyzes subscriber behavior and predicts the most suitable plan. The goal is to achieve at least 0.75 accuracy on the test dataset.
